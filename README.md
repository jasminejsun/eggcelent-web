Don't know how long to cook your egg? eggcelent - a customizable egg timer website and mobile app - can help you out to make every morning bright and sunny (side up ;D). Choose between poached, boiled, scrambled, or sunny-side-up, as well as different doneness levels. The timer continues to run if the user returns to home screen. As well, the user can control the timer through their notifications.<br />
